# InMoov-442
Dual kinematics/graphics repository for a plug-in for the choreonoid humanoid robotics simulation tool found at http://choreonoid.org

Done (partially) as coursework for CSE442 Software Engineering @ UB

## Running our Choreonoid plugin
- Currently, our plugin only runs on Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04.
- You can download the software here https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~simonmai/InMoov.zip
- Our user guide is located here https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~simonmai/#Guide
    
## Choreonoid Plugin User Guide    
- Plugin functions are listed below

  - Plugin buttons are on the toolbar of choreonoid near the top
  - Buttons must be pressed multiple times to continue walking simulation

  - "SR1" buttons can only be used with the SR1 model. Use it by clicking on SR1 on the left of choreonoid to highlight it.
  - "SR1 Walk" simulates a walking animation for SR1 model.
  - "SR1 RotateRLEG" rotates SR1 model's right leg counter clockwise.
  - "SR1 RotateLLEG" rotates SR1 model's left leg counter clockwise.

  - "LEGS" buttons must be used with the LEGS model. Use it by clicking on LEGS on the left of choreonoid to highlight it.
  - "LEGS Walk" simulates a walking animation for LEGS model.
  - "LEGS Reset" resets the LEGS model back to neutral/standing position.

Now the program is running with our working plug-in.

If at any point you encounter an error with these commands, visit http://choreonoid.org/en/manuals/1.5/install/build-ubuntu.html for debugging information.
